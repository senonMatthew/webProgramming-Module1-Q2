			<p>Hello, I'm Matthew Ira C. Senon, and I'm a 2nd year college MCM student. I'm currently taking Computer Science in the aforementioned college, and thus, I know a tiny bit about programming. I am not an interesting person, nor am I a smart one; however, I am looking to improving myself in the near future. I might as well say that I am not a particularly social person. I take pleasure in reading and gaming, yet although, those aren't my hobbies. My main hobby is creative writing, or more specifically, worldbuilding. The creation of different worlds and characters and plotting every event, occasion, and happening within these worlds are a passion of mine.</p>
			
			<p>I've begun worldbuilding way back in 2016, as a way to pass the time, if I remember correctly. Little did I know that it would spark a life-long passion for the craft, and years went by whilst I created more and more. A benefit to this hobby of mine would be that I would learn more and more about facts and trivia, as well as I would be able to polish my English while doing so. Yet, I know that I still am not yet proficient in the language, and thus, that's my secondary motivation for continuing to read and write.</p>
			
			<p>While I don't usually find the same amount of joy in programming, it's still one of my most favourite things to do. To create programs and to see hours of work finally pay off is a neat thing.</p>

				<h1>CREATE</h1>
      			<h4>Through Worldbuilding</h4>
				<p>Worldbuilding will always have a place in my heart. To be able to complete my work and to continue writing and creating more would bring me joy and happiness, no amount of money can ever give me.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="gallery__thumbnail">
				<h1>LEARN</h1>
      			<h4>Desired Skills</h4>
				<p>There is a title prevalent back in the day, in the inner cities of Italy. It was given to men who strived for excellence in whatever action they did, and they were expected to do everything with ease and finesse. That is the Renaissance Man. To reach such a manner of greatness is unrealistic, but I cannot help but try to at least even achieve a minute fraction of what these men could achieve back then.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="gallery__thumbnail">
				<h1>MASTER</h1>
      			<h4>Honed Practices</h4>
				<p>I am willing to admit that most of the things I know how to do today is due to my passion for worldbuilding. However, I plan to polish those skills to be able to perform them, not just in worldbuilding, but when they're needed outside of it. I've recently begun to self-teach myself how to draw, and I plan on improving that skill. Admittedly, I still am a newbie and an amateur, but through practice and dedication, I expect myself to improve.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="gallery__thumbnail">
				<h1>GRADUATE</h1>
      			<h4>And Persevere</h4>
				<p>Lastly, I plan on graduating. I can't really say much about this one. After I graduate, I might probably find a job that focuses on backend. I might also write a novel, it really depends. Learn from the past, act on the present, and hope for a brighter future.</p>

			<h2 class="parallax__title">The Hexagon Empire</h2>
			<p class="parallax__desc">The Hexagon Empire is a fallen empire whose roots originate from time immemorial. Their original purpose lost to time and their noble cause now corrupted into human-supremacy, the Empire staged conquest after conquest against those who dared to stand against them, before falling to a collective alliance of species whom they planned to massacre. My first project. Formulated back in 2016.</p>

			<h2 class="parallax__title" id="hazmat_title">The Immortal Regime of the Black Incursion</h2>
			<p class="parallax__desc" id="hazmat_text">A successor regime to the Hexagon Empire, the Immortal Regime idly bides its time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. An updated version of the Hexagon. Formulated back in 2019.</p>

			<h2 class="parallax__title">The Lost World of Cerrovin</h2>
			<p class="parallax__desc">A planet known for being in the midst of a cross-multiversal war, it has long since been forgotten by its past occupants. Populated by a largely fantastical assortment of flora and fauna, it builds upon the past technologies its occupants used, creating a rather diverse collection of technological fantasy gear. An attempt at a lighter, more compact setting. Formulated in 2021.</p>
